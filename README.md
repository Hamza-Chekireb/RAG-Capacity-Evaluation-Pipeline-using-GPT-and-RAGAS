# RAG-Capacity-Evaluation-Pipeline-using-GPT-and-RAGAS
This project involves the creation of a pipeline to evaluate the capabilities of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. We used GPT models to assess a RAG based on the Llama 70B model, and the evaluation is conducted using the RAGAS library.
